Today we had our first meeting at a coffee shop. We sat down excited and made some fundamental decisions for this project. We created the
github organization and debated on the technologies we would be using to implement our ideas.
We decided that we were gonna use rust rather than kotlin for this project and made ourselves a roadmap for it. We pulled in resources
from all over the web to help us, and shared our knowledge and preferences.

We all came to an agreement on how we were gonna get started for this project.

- First we will start off by becoming used to rust, i.e. the syntax, and programming style, etc.
- Then we shall start to learn how to code the components that make a cryptocurrency, i.e. p2p networks, the lockchain, etc.
- Then we start contributing to the official Crytpo-Coin repository on [github](https://github.com/Crytpo-Coin).


You can check our goals and roadmaps [here](/docs/roadmap/inital/).
