Today we had our first meeting at a coffee shop. We sat down excited and made some fundamental decisions for this project. We created the
GitHub organisation and debated on the technologies we would be using to implement our ideas.
We decided that we were going to use Rust rather than Kotlin for this project and made ourselves a roadmap for it. We pulled in resources
from all over the web to help us, and shared our knowledge and preferences.

We all came to an agreement on how we were gonna get started for this project:

- Learning Rust, including the syntax, programming style, etc
- Learning components that make a cryptocurrency, such as P2P networks, the lockchain, etc
- Programming and committing onto, component-by-component, the official Crytpo-Coin repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Crytpo-Coin)


You can check our goals and roadmaps [here](/docs/roadmap/inital/).
